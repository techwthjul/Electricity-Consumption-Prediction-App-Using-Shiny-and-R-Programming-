## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r}
# Load your data
data <- read.csv("merged_energy_weather_data.csv")

# Splitting the data into training and test sets
set.seed(123) # for reproducibility
train_indices <- sample(1:nrow(data), 0.8 * nrow(data))
train_data <- data[train_indices, ]
test_data <- data[-train_indices, ]

# Building the linear regression model
# Including only the selected variables
model <- lm(total_energy_usage ~ 
                                in.cooling_setpoint + 
                                in.heating_setpoint + 
                                in.bedrooms +
                                in.sqft + time + Dry.Bulb.Temperature...C., data = train_data)

# Summary of the model
summary(model)

# Predicting on the test set
predictions <- predict(model, test_data)

# Evaluating the model
mse <- mean((predictions - test_data$total_energy_usage)^2)
mse
```

```{r}
# Load the required library
library(rpart)

# Building the Decision Tree regression model
model_dt <- rpart(total_energy_usage ~ 
                   in.cooling_setpoint + 
                   in.heating_setpoint + 
                   in.bedrooms +
                   in.sqft + time + Dry.Bulb.Temperature...C., data = train_data)

# Summary of the Decision Tree model
summary(model_dt)

# Predicting on the test set
predictions_dt <- predict(model_dt, test_data)

# Evaluating the Decision Tree model
mse_dt <- mean((predictions_dt - test_data$total_energy_usage)^2)
mse_dt
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
